# MIA_Phonegap

## Purpose


## Framework
**Ionic 1.0.0**: we use Ionic to make use of AngularJS on mobile and the great building tools that come with Ionic-cli


## UI
**Materialize.css**: our design pattern is Material Design, so we use materialize to overrule some Ionic styles.

**Color Palette**: from the Material Design Color Palette, we are going to work with the colors Indigo and Pink. Bright Pinks stimulate energy and encourage action and confidence. Indigo (purple family) has and uplifting effect.


## Plugins
**Pushnotificaties**

**Facebook OAuth**: we make use of the Facebook OAuth plugin so we can same habits for every user in a database and make rankings between friends possible.


## Database
**PouchDB**: PouchDB which saves offline. PouchDB can also sync very easily with a external CouchDB
